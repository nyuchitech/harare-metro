## üìù Notes

### Architecture Decisions

1. **2-Worker Architecture**: Maintaining separate frontend and backend workers for clean separation of concerns
2. **No Account Worker**: Consolidated auth into backend worker for simplicity
3. **D1 + KV Auth**: Custom OpenAuth instead of Supabase for full control and cost efficiency
4. **Mobile-First**: TikTok-inspired design for Zimbabwe's mobile-first market

### Key Principles

- **Simplicity**: Keep architecture simple and maintainable
- **Performance**: Fast load times critical for mobile users
- **Cost-Effective**: Leverage Cloudflare's free tier
- **Zimbabwe-First**: Design for Zimbabwe's infrastructure and user needs
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Mobile experience is the primary experience
