# Harare Metro - KV to D1 Migration Summary

## üéØ Migration Overview

This migration replaces all KV storage with a single Cloudflare D1 database for better scalability and performance as the user base grows.

## üìã What Was Migrated

### From: 5 Different KV Namespaces
- `HM_CONFIGURATIONS` - System settings and configuration  
- `HM_CACHE_STORAGE` - Article cache storage
- `HM_NEWS_STORAGE` - RSS feeds, categories, keywords
- `HM_CACHE_CONFIG` - Cache configuration settings  
- `HM_USER_STORAGE` - User interactions (now moved to Supabase)

### To: Single D1 Database (`ARTICLES_DB`)
- **Consolidated storage** in one scalable D1 database
- **Better performance** with SQL queries vs KV gets
- **ACID transactions** for data consistency
- **Easier management** with standard database tools

## üèóÔ∏è New Database Schema

### Configuration Tables
- `system_config` - Application settings and limits
- `rss_sources` - News sources with status tracking
- `categories` - Content categories with keywords
- `trusted_domains` - Whitelisted image domains

### Content Tables  
- `articles` - Main articles with full-text search
- `article_keywords` - Search optimization
- `cache_metadata` - Temporary cache with TTL
- `feed_status` - RSS processing status

### Analytics Tables
- `search_logs` - Anonymous search analytics

## üîß New Services

### Core Services (Replacing KV Services)
- `D1ConfigService` - Configuration management via D1
- `D1CacheService` - Caching and article management via D1
- `D1Service` - Low-level D1 database operations

### Updated Worker
- `worker/index-d1.js` - New D1-powered worker
- `worker/index-kv-backup.js` - Backup of original KV worker

## üìä Architecture Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- **Single database connection** vs multiple KV namespace calls
- **SQL queries** for complex filtering and searching  
- **Indexed searches** for fast article retrieval
- **Batch operations** for efficient bulk updates

### Scalability Improvements
- **No KV key limitations** - D1 supports millions of records
- **Complex relationships** between articles, sources, and categories
- **Full-text search** capabilities built-in
- **Concurrent access** with proper locking

### Maintenance Improvements
- **Standard SQL** for database operations
- **Easy backups** with D1 export functionality
- **Schema migrations** with versioned scripts
- **Better monitoring** with D1 analytics

## üöÄ Migration Process

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Run the migration script
./scripts/migrate-d1.sh
```

### 2. Manual Steps (if needed)
```bash
# Create D1 database
wrangler d1 create hararemetro_articles

# Run schema migration
wrangler d1 execute hararemetro_articles --file=worker/database/migrations/001_init_schema.sql

# Seed initial data  
wrangler d1 execute hararemetro_articles --file=worker/database/migrations/002_seed_initial_data.sql
```

### 3. Deploy Updated Worker
```bash
# Test locally first
npm run dev

# Deploy to preview
wrangler deploy --env preview

# Deploy to production when ready
wrangler deploy
```

## üìö Database Management

### Common Operations
```bash
# Query articles
wrangler d1 execute hararemetro_articles --command="SELECT COUNT(*) FROM articles;"

# View system configuration  
wrangler d1 execute hararemetro_articles --command="SELECT * FROM system_config;"

# Check RSS sources
wrangler d1 execute hararemetro_articles --command="SELECT name, enabled, last_fetched_at FROM rss_sources;"

# Backup database
wrangler d1 export hararemetro_articles --output backup.sql

# View table schema
wrangler d1 execute hararemetro_articles --command=".schema articles"
```

### Monitoring Queries
```sql
-- Article statistics
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_articles,
  COUNT(DISTINCT source_id) as active_sources,
  MAX(published_at) as latest_article
FROM articles;

-- RSS source health
SELECT 
  name,
  enabled,
  fetch_count,
  error_count,
  last_fetched_at
FROM rss_sources 
ORDER BY error_count DESC;

-- Cache performance
SELECT 
  cache_type,
  COUNT(*) as entries,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN expires_at > datetime('now') THEN 1 END) as active_entries
FROM cache_metadata 
GROUP BY cache_type;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### What Stays the Same
- **User data remains in Supabase** (profiles, bookmarks, likes)
- **Analytics continue using Analytics Engine** (not D1)  
- **Images continue using Cloudflare Images** (not D1)
- **Frontend React app unchanged** - same user experience

### What Changed
- **Worker now uses D1Service instead of ConfigService/CacheService**
- **RSS processing writes directly to D1**
- **Article search now uses SQL queries**
- **Configuration stored in D1 system_config table**

### Breaking Changes
- **Old KV-based worker backed up** to `worker/index-kv-backup.js`
- **Environment requires ARTICLES_DB binding** (already in wrangler.toml)
- **KV namespace bindings no longer required** (can be removed after testing)

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] D1 database created and accessible
- [ ] Schema migration completed successfully  
- [ ] Initial data seeded (RSS sources, categories, config)
- [ ] Local development works (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Articles are being fetched and stored in D1
- [ ] Search functionality works with D1 queries
- [ ] Preview deployment successful
- [ ] Production deployment ready

## üîÑ Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues arise, rollback is simple:
```bash
# Restore original KV-based worker
cp worker/index-kv-backup.js worker/index.js

# Redeploy
wrangler deploy
```

All KV namespaces remain intact during migration for safety.

## üéâ Expected Benefits After Migration

### For Users
- **Faster article loading** with optimized D1 queries
- **Better search results** with full-text search capabilities  
- **More reliable service** with D1's consistency guarantees
- **Improved uptime** with reduced KV dependency issues

### For Developers  
- **Simpler architecture** with single database
- **Better debugging** with SQL query logs
- **Easier feature development** with relational data
- **Standard database tooling** for management

### For Operations
- **Reduced complexity** - one database vs 5 KV namespaces
- **Better monitoring** with D1 analytics dashboard
- **Easier backups** with SQL export functionality
- **Lower costs** at scale compared to KV storage
